Hi there, I'm Courtney 👋
🌱 Graduated from the Makers Academy bootcamp (Oct2021 Cohort)
🔭 I’m currently working as a Software Engineer at Xander Talent
🥅 2023 Goals: Maximise my learning, contribute to new projects
⚡ Fun facts: I enjoy going to the gym 🏋️ playing the drums 🥁 playing video games 🎮
After being made redundant from my previous job I thought it was time for a change and to do something I'm passionate about. After 3 months of self-study I joined Makers Academy to improve my coding and to learn new skills and languages to make me a desirable candidate for my future employer. As of September 2022 I started my journey as a Software Engineering Consultant.

I now have a strong understanding of the software development life cycle and a passion for delivering high-quality, well-designed products. I have experienced a variety of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript and Ruby. I have also worked with web development frameworks such as Django, React and Ruby on Rails.

I enjoy working on challenging projects that require creative problem-solving and attention to detail, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and programming languages. I am a motivated and collaborative team player who is dedicated to delivering outstanding results on every project I work on.
