<p>After being made redundant from my previous career I thought it was time for a change and to do something I'm passionate about. After 3 months of self-study I joined QA Academy to improve my coding and to learn new skills and languages to make me a desirable candidate for my future employer. As of April 2023 I started my journey as a Software Engineering Consultant.</p>

I now have a strong understanding of the software development life cycle and a passion for delivering high-quality, well-designed products. I have experienced a variety of programming languages, including Java, Python, JavaScript and SQL. I have also worked with web development frameworks such as Django, React and Angular on Rails.

I enjoy working on challenging projects that require creative problem-solving and attention to detail, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and programming languages. I am a motivated and collaborative team player who is dedicated to delivering outstanding results on every project I work on.
